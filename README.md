# Countdown Numbers Game (Streamlit App)

This is an interactive brain game inspired by the Numbers Round from *8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown*.

## How It Works

- You are given **6 random numbers** (a mix of large and small).
- A random **target number between 100 and 999** is generated.
- You must use `+`, `−`, `×`, or `÷` to reach the target.
- Each number can only be used **once**.
- After trying it yourself, click **“Reveal Solution”** to see what the AI came up with!
